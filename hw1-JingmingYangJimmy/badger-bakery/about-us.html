			<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
			<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text <i>ever since the 1500s</i>, 
				when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
			<h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
			<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical <i>Latin literature</i> from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <strong>Richard McClintock</strong>, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
